        <div class="aboutCB">In randomized groups, we were tasked with creating a 60-page cookbook with the topic of our
            choosing. I chose the idea of a collection of recipes for foraging materials due to the plentifulness of
            nature around where I grew up. My portion of the work included layout, font choice, content, as well as the
            cover. </div>

        <div class="STCFcircle"><img class="STCF" src="img/STCF.jpg"></div>
        <div class="aboutSTCF">A creative brief was handed to me, at random, for this project. We needed to brand an entire festival using the topics given, mine being the Shark Tank Comedy Festival. The premise is similar to the actual show, Shark Tank, except people can sign up to give 'joke pitches' to a panel of judges to win a prize. I created things like a logo, program pamphlet, poster, and social media posts to promote this event. Keeping with the lighthearted theme, I used bright and fun colors. </div>

        <div class="aboutCRW">I was assigned an artist to create an information website about, detailing their personal life, work, awards, and style. Camila Rosa was given to me, and I found she is a very prominent graphic designer who works with bold colors and concepts. I chose to use the same colors she does in her works to categorize each page, as well as to keep the same 2D minimalistic theme throughout to reflect her style. An interactive website coming soon!</div>

        <div class="aboutLL">For this project, we wer mean to create and design an event that would take you through Uptown Normal and show attractions of this town. I chose to do a coffee adventure, where you are directed to 4 different local cafe's here in Normal Illinois to see how the flavors comapre. I created a brochure as well as ideas for real-world applications that would direct conusmers where they needed to go.</div>
